# From warmth to worry

This repository contains the data and R code required to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript titled "From warmth to worry: Heating behaviours and energy deprivation during the 2022 energy crisis". The paper has been submitted to the Journal of Environmental Management on 28 March 2025.

This research benefitted from funding by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme under the project <a href="fulfill-sufficiency.eu">FULFILL</a> - Fundamental decarbonisation through sufficiency by lifestyle changes  (Grant agreement ID 101003656).

This project include the following files:

## Section 0: Data Wrangling
This section includes scripts for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the raw data for analysis. The code standardises variables, handles missing values, and constructs the final dataset utilised in subsequent analyses.

## Section 1 Descriptives
This section provides the code necessary to replicate the descriptive statistics and visualisations featured in the manuscript. It reproduces Figures 1 to 3, and Table A1, which presents additional descriptive data.

## Section 2 Multivariate analysis
This section contains the code to reproduce the econometric analyses and visualisations. In particular, it generates Figure 4, which summarises the results of our multivariate analysis.

## Section 3 Appendix B and Appendix C
This section provides the code to reproduce the main econometric results Tables B1, B2, B3 and the robusteness check Tables C1 to C11.

## Requirements
- R (version 4.4.2 or later)
- The required R packages: tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, readr,  and any other dependencies specified within the individual scripts.
